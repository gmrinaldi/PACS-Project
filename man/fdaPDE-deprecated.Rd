\item{locations}{A #observations-by-2 matrix where each row specifies the spatial coordinates of the corresponding observations in the vector \code{observations}.}

\item{observations}{A #observations vector with the observed data values over the domain. The locations of the observations can be specified with the \code{locations} argument.
Otherwise if only the vector of observations is given, these are consider to be located in the corresponding node in the table nodes of the mesh. In this last
case, an \code{NA} value in the observations vector indicates that there is no observation associated to the corresponding node.}

\item{lambda}{A scalar or vector of smoothing parameters.}

\item{covariates}{A #observations-by-#covariates matrix where each row represents the covariates associated with the corresponding observed data value in \code{observations}.}

\item{GCV}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE} the following quantities are computed: the trace of the smoothing matrix, the estimated error standard deviation,  and 
the Generalized Cross Validation criterion, for each value of the smoothing parameter specified in \code{lambda}.}

\item{nderivs}{A vector of lenght 2 specifying the order of the partial derivatives of the bases to be evaluated. The vectors' entries can
be 0,1 or 2, where 0 indicates that only the basis functions, and not their derivatives, should be evaluated.}

In this case the function \code{create.MESH.2D} is used to produce a complete MESH2D object.}

This function implements a spatial regression model with differential regularization; isotropic and stationary case. In particular, the regularizing term involves the Laplacian of the spatial field. Space-varying covariates can be included in the model. The technique accurately handle data distributed over irregularly shaped domains. Moreover, various conditions can be imposed at the domain boundaries.

This function is a wrapper of the Triangle library (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html). It can be used
to create a triangulation of the domain of interest starting from a list of points, to be used as triangles' vertices, and a list of segments, that define the domain boundary. The resulting
mesh is a Constrained Delaunay triangulation. This is constructed in a way to preserve segments provided in the input \code{segments} without splitting them. This imput can be used to define the boundaries
of the domain. If this imput is NULL, it generates a triangulation over the
convex hull of the points.

This function refines a Constrained Delaunay triangulation into a Conforming Delaunay triangulation. This is a wrapper of the Triangle library (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html). It can be used to 
refine a mesh created previously with \link{create.MESH.2D}. The algorithm can add Steiner points (points through which the \code{segments} are splitted)
in order to meet the imposed refinement conditions.
